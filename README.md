# ‚òÅÔ∏è Shapeshift

ü©∂ A strategic board game inspired by Quarto and Chess.  :)

Align pieces by shape, size, or color‚Äîand stay one step ahead of your opponent!

The draw pool order is unpredictable‚Äîyour opponent can be given the exact piece you need.

Piece-movement adds a second layer: any piece can be shifted, blocking or creating new lines.

## ‚úº Overview

Shapeshift is played on a 5√ó5 grid with exactly eight unique pieces.  
Each piece has three attributes:
- **Color:** Black or White  
- **Shape:** Heart or Square  
- **Size:** Big or Small  

Players take turns **drawing** a random piece from the pool and **placing** it, or **moving** any piece on the board. Your goal is to form a line of **four** pieces sharing one attribute (shape, size, or color) in a row, column, or diagonal.
